# Vulkan Engine [Development]

This is my first engine with Vulkan. This engine was built while learning Vulkan from the beginning and will continue to see further improvements and changes
with new features as I continue to learn more about computer graphics programming and the Vulkan API.

Since this is my first attempt at building an engine using Vulkan, there might be some obvious issues. These issues are most likely fixed 
and will be availble to view in the **Development** branch.

**Install**
* [VulkanSDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)

**Externals**:
* [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
* [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
* [STB](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
